# Contributing

Thanks for helping others learn SplashKit!

## Ways to contribute
- Propose a **lesson idea** (new doc in `docs/`).
- Improve **code comments** and **README**.
- Add **exercises** or **solutions**.
- Report and fix **issues** (clarity, typos, broken code).

## Guidelines
- Keep examples tiny (under ~120 lines per file when possible).
- Prefer **clear variable names** and **step-by-step** comments.
- Each doc should end with a "Teach It Forward" section encouraging peer help.
