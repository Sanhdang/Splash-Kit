# SplashKit Learning Starter

A hands-on project to help beginners **learn SplashKit** through small, focused exercises and mini-demos.
Use this repo in your class or self-study; each module builds a single concept with code you can run and extend.

> Built for SIT771 learners who want to *help others* through tutorials, examples, and contributions.

## What's inside
- `src/HelloSplashKit/` – your first runnable SplashKit app (window, input, draw, exit).
- `src/SKRunner/` – a tiny endless-runner style demo (keyboard movement, collisions, score, sounds).
- `docs/` – step-by-step tutorials with code snippets and small tasks to practice.
- `exercises/` – bite-size tasks you can assign to friends/classmates to check understanding.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – how to propose improvements, open issues, and add new lessons.
- `LICENSE` – MIT, so you can reuse freely in class projects.

## Quick start
1. **Install SplashKit** (follow your platform guide).
2. Clone this repo and open the solution in VS Code / JetBrains Rider / Visual Studio.
3. Build and run `HelloSplashKit` first to verify your SplashKit install.
4. Explore and extend `SKRunner` to practice sprites, collisions, and sound.

## Repo goals
- Teach SplashKit concepts with *minimal boilerplate* and *short files* you can read in minutes.
- Encourage **helping others**: each lesson ends with "Teach It Forward" prompts – post answers, tips, or recordings.
- Enable portfolio evidence (tutorials, code reviews, contributions) for coursework.

## Modules & concepts
- Window + draw loop, input, timing
- Shapes, text, sprites, bitmap loading
- Collisions (AABB + pixel-perfect)
- Sound & music
- Simple animations (sprite sheets)
- Game structuring (entities, update/draw, scenes)

## How to contribute
- Open an issue with the template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/lesson_idea.md`.
- Add a new doc in `docs/` or a new mini-demo in `src/`.
- Keep examples **small** and **commented**.
- Record a short GIF or screen capture to show the result.

Happy learning and teaching!
